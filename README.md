# Excel_Marathons
## Overview
This is the repo for a guided analysis project. We had to load the dataset into Excel and answer a series of questions including 2 bonuses to become familiar with basic Excel functions and formulas. We then had to create a slideshow to present our findings. The finished slideshow can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pjQPzxHTfMB2JBgRDPcivBnSKcQZzOcd1ym6_rpR36g/edit?usp=sharing).
## Project Takeaways
As the first Excel project I did with a decent dataset, this was a bit daunting. How little I knew! I did learn some neat tricks like large/small. I had a collaborative team that worked well together so it was a good experience with an analytics team as well.
## The Pitch
Perform the following guided analysis then compose a 5 minute presentation to show off your findings:
 - Find the fastest time, slowest time, median, and mean times for each of the 8 races.
 - Find the mean and median marathon finish times for all 4 years combined.
 - Find the mean and median half-marathon finish times for all 4 years combined.
 - First time marathoners sometimes set a goal of beating Oprah’s time, Oprah Winfrey’s time (04:29:20) in the 1994 Marine Corps Marathon when she was 40 years old. How many runners each year beat Oprah’s time? What percentage of runners in each of the 4 marathons beat Oprah’s time?
 - Find the values that define the first, second, and third quartiles for each half-marathon.
 - Is there a year in which runners seem slower or faster? Formulate a hypothesis for any apparent differences.
 - Scott Wietecha has won the Rock and Roll Marathon for 7 years in a row. Compute and display the difference between Wietecha’s time and the next fastest runner for each year.

BONUS: Find the top 5 runners for 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. Remove any duplicates across years (i.e., Scott Wietecha should only be in the list once). How many unique runners finished at one of the top 5 spots in the past 4 races?
In how many of the 4 years did each top 5 runner finish? How has each runner’s time changed from year to year?

BONUS 2: How many runners ran in at least 2 of the 4 marathons? Did any runner compete in all 4 of the marathons in our dataset?

## The Data
The complication here was all the sheets: 8 in total. This made pulling totals and aggregates from each a complex task. It was nicely regular though: every sheet had the same columns in the same order, making it simple to remember where everything was located.
## Approach to the Problem
Because this was a pretty heavily guided exercise, I followed the prompts above, but due to the team willing to put in extra time, we raced through to the bonus questions and were able to answer both in our presentation. I ended up creating the 2 slides covering the bonus questions (each of my teammates chose one-two questions to cover in a slide so that everyone had something to present).
